Hi there,
Heres an example of a console game written in c++. I assume everyone knows how to play it- if you dont, check it out here maybe Ull find it entertaining.
Heres are the features of the application:
Prevents user from typing invalid characters,
Counts letters and words left to gues,
Uses a Class (This can be especialy helpfull if you were forced to use one for a school project)
Communication with user is in polish, there are pretty obvious logs.
While running this app keep in mind that you have to use "-" instead of spaces between words.
I wrote this program in Xcode and Eclipse, that mean system clear did not realy work for me- If you are using xtern console you can add system("clear") to your code, so typed word will be instantly hidden.

Here is the code, it is on dropbox so I can easily change those files. Any feedback on this program will be aprichiated :), Im sure theres a lot to fix still ;)
